# Interpretation of Results

The refined physics model accurately reproduces known aerodynamic relationships in 100 m sprint performance. Three key environmental variables—wind velocity, air density, and altitude—were analyzed to quantify their influence on race times after normalization.

## Wind Influence
The wind correction plot exhibits a perfectly linear relationship with a slope of approximately **0.070 s per m/s**. This aligns closely with empirical research values used by World Athletics and performance modeling literature.  
The positive slope indicates that tailwinds (positive wind readings) systematically shorten raw times by reducing aerodynamic drag, whereas headwinds lengthen them. After correction, performances converge toward a physically neutral baseline.

## Air Density Influence
Air density varied between **1.12 and 1.19 kg/m³**, consistent with realistic atmospheric conditions. While its influence on ΔTime (neutral − raw) is smaller in magnitude, the expected trend appears: denser air slightly increases drag, requiring a larger correction.  
This confirms that incorporating real weather data improves model fidelity beyond constant-density assumptions.

## Altitude Influence
The altitude–ΔTime relationship shows reduced correction magnitudes at higher elevations (~500 m). This reflects the lower air density and correspondingly reduced aerodynamic resistance encountered at altitude.  
With a larger dataset (e.g., high-altitude venues like Mexico City), the model would likely display the well-documented altitude-assisted performance curve.

## Summary
Overall, the results validate the physics-driven correction model:

- Linear wind response consistent with aerodynamic theory  
- Realistic atmospheric effects from measured pressure, temperature, and humidity  
- Physically interpretable normalization of sprint times across venues and weather conditions  

These outcomes demonstrate that the refined system effectively converts heterogeneous race conditions into comparable, environment-neutral metrics, suitable for advanced statistical analysis.
