# KineticGen
KineticGen is a Python-based sprint analytics system that applies the principles of physics and differential equations to human motion. By processing inputs such as force, wind speed, mass, and environmental conditions, it simulates the complete sprint dynamic to produce accurate representations of how an athlete accelerates, reaches top speed, and decelerates. The program outputs detailed metrics including velocity–time and acceleration–time curves, estimated energy expenditure, mechanical efficiency, and predicted race times. Designed for both research and athletic innovation, KineticGen bridges biomechanics, data science, and physics to help athletes understand and optimize performance at a fundamental level.
